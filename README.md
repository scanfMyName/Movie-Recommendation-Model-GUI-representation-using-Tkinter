# Movie Recommendation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various methods for movie recommendations. 

## Basic Recommendations

1. The first method shows how to get the top 10 movies generally.
2. The second method shows how to get the top 10 movies based on genre.

## Content-Based Recommendations

The third method uses content-based recommendation to give the top 10 similar movies to a particular movie.

## Collaborative Filtering

The fourth method uses collaborative filtering to give recommendations to a user based on their past ratings to some movies. This method uses the SVD Algorithm and XGBoost model to give recommendations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/[username]/movie-recommendation.git

2. Install the required packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
